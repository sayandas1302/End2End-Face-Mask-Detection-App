# End2End-Face-Mask-Detection-App
In this project we are going to build an app that can apply some deep learning algorithm to detect whether a face is masked or not from its image.

### Getting started
1. Download the entire project folder. 
2. Create a virtual environment and install all the packages that are mentioned under the 'requirements.txt' file.
3. Once everthing is set you can run the 'app.py' file from the cmd prompt by using 'streamlit run app.py' command. After this the app will be loaded.
4. The .ipynb file has all the procedures for the model building portion.
5. Enjoy the app.
